## registers {#registers}

The processorâ€™s 32 general-purpose registers are stored in a <span class="underline">structure</span> called a [register file]({{< relref "register file.md" >}}).

control unit truth table: 7-bit opcode to

-   two 1-bit signals that are used to control multiplexors (ALUSrc and MemtoReg),
-   three signals for controlling reads and writes in the register file and data memory (RegWrite, MemRead, and MemWrite),
-   a 1-bit signal used in determining whether to possibly branch (Branch),
-   a 2-bit control signal for the ALU (ALUOp).

Notice that PCSrc(controls the selection of the next PC) is now a derived signal, rather than one coming directly from the control unit.
