why qemu always stuck at VNC server running on ::1:5900?

# A by GPT
When QEMU appears to be stuck at the message "VNC server running on ::1:5900," it typically indicates that QEMU is running and waiting for a VNC client to connect to the virtual machine's graphical output. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Verify VNC Client Connection**:
   - Make sure you are using a VNC client to connect to the VNC server started by QEMU. You should connect to `localhost:5900` or `::1:5900`.
   - If you're running the VNC client on a different machine, ensure that the network allows connections on port 5900.

2. **Check Network Settings**:
   - If you're connecting from the same machine, make sure nothing is blocking the connection to `::1` (IPv6 localhost) or `127.0.0.1` (IPv4 localhost).
   - If you're connecting from a different device, ensure that the firewall settings on the host running QEMU allow inbound connections on port 5900.

3. **Look for Misconfigurations in QEMU Command**:
   - Review the QEMU command line used to start the VM. Ensure there are no errors in the configuration, especially related to networking or graphical output settings.
   - You can also try to specify a different VNC port or disable VNC by using another graphical output method like SDL or Spice.

4. **Check for QEMU Logs or Output**:
   - Look for any additional logs or console outputs from QEMU that might indicate what it is doing. Sometimes QEMU could be waiting for some other resources or processes.

5. **Test with Different VNC Viewers**:
   - Sometimes, the issue might be with the VNC viewer itself. Try using a different VNC viewer to see if the problem persists.

6. **Ensure the VM is Booting Properly**:
   - Sometimes the VM might be stuck at an early boot stage or encountering a boot error. If possible, check the VM's display through QEMU's built-in SDL display to see if the VM is progressing past the boot stage.

If you've tried these steps and still face issues, it might be useful to provide more specific details about the QEMU command line you're using and the setup of your environment.
# Q by user
why qemu vnc server stuck at booting from hard disk?
# A by GPT
If QEMU's VNC server is stuck at a message like "Booting from Hard Disk" and doesn't proceed, it generally suggests an issue with the boot process or disk image. Here are several steps and checks you can perform to troubleshoot this problem:

1. **Check the Disk Image**:
   - Verify that the disk image you're trying to boot from is valid and not corrupted. You can check the image file’s integrity, if possible, by comparing checksums or using it on a different virtual machine setup to see if it boots.
   - Ensure that the disk image has a bootable operating system installed. Sometimes, the disk image might be a data disk without a boot loader or operating system.

2. **QEMU Command Line**:
   - Review the QEMU command line to ensure that the disk image is correctly specified and that the boot order is properly configured. Make sure that the syntax is correct, and that paths to the disk images are accurate.
   - Example of a typical QEMU command to boot from a disk image:
     ```bash
     qemu-system-x86_64 -hda /path/to/disk_image.img -m 1024 -vnc :0
     ```
   - Ensure that no necessary options are missing, such as specifying a particular machine type (`-machine type=`) or CPU (`-cpu host`), which might be necessary depending on the operating system.

3. **BIOS/UEFI Settings**:
   - Check if the BIOS or UEFI settings within QEMU are set to boot from the correct device. This might involve tweaking the boot device priority.

4. **Virtual Machine Configuration**:
   - Make sure that the virtual hardware configuration is compatible with the OS. For example, some operating systems might require specific types of virtual network adapters or storage controllers.

5. **Check for Bootloader Issues**:
   - If the disk image was modified or created from scratch, ensure that a proper bootloader is installed (like GRUB for Linux-based systems). You might need to mount the image on another system and install or repair the bootloader.

6. **VM Console Output**:
   - Try to get more output from the virtual machine’s console. Sometimes, additional output can be enabled through QEMU options, which can provide more insight into what the VM is doing or where it is stuck.
   - You might also switch the graphical output from VNC to SDL temporarily by using `-display sdl` instead of `-vnc :0` to see if any error messages are displayed on the QEMU graphical console.

7. **Resource and Environment Check**:
   - Ensure that the host system has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM) to run the virtual machine. Insufficient resources can sometimes cause the VM to hang during the boot process.
   - Check for any other environmental issues that could affect QEMU’s operation, such as software conflicts or permissions issues.

By systematically checking these areas, you should be able to diagnose why the VM is stuck at booting from the hard disk. If you continue to experience issues, providing more details about your QEMU setup and configuration might help diagnose the problem further.
# Q by user
here is my qemu command:
qemu-system-x86_64
		-serial
		mon:stdio
		-machine
		accel=tcg
		-smp
		"1,cores=1,sockets=1"
		-drive
		format=raw,file=AM/demo/build/hello-x86_64-qemu

# A by GPT
Thanks for sharing your QEMU command. Let's review and refine it to address the issue of the VM getting stuck at "Booting from Hard Disk." Here are a few aspects and suggestions:

1. **Serial and Monitor Settings**:
   - The `-serial mon:stdio` option redirects the serial port to the standard input/output. This is fine if you want to interact with the VM through QEMU's console. Ensure that this is the intended behavior, as it can take over the terminal.

2. **Machine and Acceleration**:
   - The `-machine accel=tcg` indicates that QEMU is using software emulation (TCG). This is typically slower but more compatible. If you're running QEMU on a system that supports hardware virtualization (like KVM on Linux), you might want to switch to `-machine accel=kvm` if your system supports it for better performance.

3. **SMP Configuration**:
   - Your `-smp "1,cores=1,sockets=1"` setting is specifying one CPU. This should generally be fine for simple or legacy systems but ensure it meets the requirements of the operating system you are running.

4. **Drive Configuration**:
   - You've specified `-drive format=raw,file=AM/demo/build/hello-x86_64-qemu`. This command line suggests you are using a raw disk image named `hello-x86_64-qemu`. 
   - Ensure that the file path is correct and the disk image is accessible and not corrupted. Also, confirm that this image has a bootable operating system with a properly configured bootloader. If it's just a data image or a newly created image, it might not have a bootloader installed, which would prevent it from booting.

5. **Missing Display Configuration**:
   - Your command does not explicitly specify a display option (like VNC or SDL). If you're running this on a server or remotely, you might want to add `-display none` for headless operation or `-vnc :0` to access it via VNC.

6. **Additional Boot Options**:
   - Consider adding `-boot order=d` to explicitly set the boot device order, ensuring it tries to boot from the disk first.

Here’s a revised version of your command with some suggestions included (assuming you want to stick with software emulation and correct some potential oversights):

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
	-serial mon:stdio \
	-machine accel=tcg \
	-smp 1,cores=1,sockets=1 \
	-drive format=raw,file=AM/demo/build/hello-x86_64-qemu \
	-display none \
	-boot order=d
```

If your setup still does not work:
- Verify the content and bootability of your disk image.
- Check if any errors are printed to the terminal when starting QEMU.
- Try a different disk image known to work to isolate whether the issue is with the image or the QEMU configuration.

Let me know if you have specific requirements or if there are more details about your setup that could affect how QEMU should be configured!
# Q by user
how to redirect print out content in qemu to terminal
# A by GPT
To redirect the output of a virtual machine running in QEMU to your terminal, you can utilize the `-serial mon:stdio` option, which you already have in your command. This setup redirects the serial console of the VM to the standard input/output of the terminal where QEMU is launched. However, for this to work effectively, the operating system inside the VM also needs to be configured to send its console output to the serial port. Here’s how you can ensure everything is set up correctly:

### 1. **QEMU Configuration**

You have already included `-serial mon:stdio` in your command. This should direct the VM's serial port output to your terminal.

### 2. **Operating System Configuration**

The guest operating system must be configured to output to the serial console. This setup varies depending on the operating system:

#### For Linux:

You need to modify the boot parameters of the Linux kernel to include console output redirection to the serial port. This is typically done by adding `console=ttyS0` to the kernel boot parameters. If you're using GRUB as a bootloader, you can add this parameter in the GRUB configuration file (`/etc/default/grub`) like so:

```plaintext
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS0"
```

After modifying the GRUB configuration file, update GRUB with:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

Make sure to use the correct serial device (`ttyS0` is common, but it could be different depending on your setup).

#### For Windows:

Windows generally does not use the serial port for normal operations. Enabling serial console redirection in Windows is more complex and often involves registry changes or special boot configurations.

### 3. **Example QEMU Command**

Here’s an example command that incorporates everything, assuming a Linux guest:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -machine accel=tcg \
    -cpu host \
    -smp cores=2 \
    -m 2048 \
    -drive file=/path/to/your/bootable/image.img,format=raw,index=0,media=disk \
    -serial mon:stdio \
    -nographic
```

- The `-nographic` option is used here to disable graphical output and interact entirely through the terminal, which might be helpful if you're focusing on serial output.

### 4. **Testing the Setup**

After setting up the QEMU command and configuring the guest OS, you should see the output in your terminal when the VM boots. If the OS inside the VM is configured correctly, all boot messages and interactions that are typically shown on a physical console should appear in your QEMU terminal.

Ensure that every step is followed accurately to see the output redirection effectively. If you encounter any issues, double-check the guest OS configurations and the QEMU command options.
# Q by user
qemu-img -f raw kernel-dev-archlinux.img 4G
error message is: 
qemu-img: unrecognized option '-f'
Try 'qemu-img --help' for more information


# A by GPT
The error message you're seeing indicates that the `qemu-img` command syntax is incorrect. The `-f` option is typically used to specify the format of the disk image, but it appears that the overall command structure is wrong.

The correct syntax to create a new disk image with `qemu-img` should include the `create` command, and the order of the options and arguments also matters. Here is how you can correctly structure the command to create a new raw disk image of size 4G:

```bash
qemu-img create -f raw kernel-dev-archlinux.img 4G
```

Here's a breakdown of the command:
- `qemu-img` is the tool for disk image management.
- `create` is the command to create a new image.
- `-f raw` specifies the format of the disk image. In this case, it's `raw`, which is a common format that represents the disk image as a flat file.
- `kernel-dev-archlinux.img` is the filename for the new disk image.
- `4G` specifies the size of the disk image, in this case, 4 gigabytes.

If you run the above command, it should successfully create a new 4 GB raw disk image named `kernel-dev-archlinux.img` without any errors. Make sure you have sufficient disk space available where you're creating the image.
# Q by user
write a bash script to generate a minimal bootable image and print "Hello world." when booting using qemu, and write qemu command to load this image
# A by GPT
Creating a minimal bootable disk image that prints "Hello World" when booted using QEMU involves several steps, including setting up a basic bootloader that can output text to the screen. Here, we will use `nasm` (Netwide Assembler) for assembling the bootloader and `dd` to create a disk image.

### 1. Create the Bootloader

First, we'll write an assembly script for a bootloader that simply prints "Hello World" to the screen. You need `nasm` installed to assemble this script into binary format.

Create a file named `bootloader.asm` with the following content:

```asm
BITS 16                  ; Tell NASM we're working in 16-bit mode
ORG 0x7C00               ; Origin, tells where the code will be in memory

start:
    mov ah, 0x0E         ; int 0x10 teletype function
    mov bh, 0x00         ; page number
    mov bl, 0x07         ; text attribute (white on black)

    mov si, hello_world  ; Load the address of the string into SI
.print_char:
    lodsb                ; Load string byte at SI into AL
    or al, al            ; OR AL with itself
    jz hang              ; If AL is zero, jump to hang
    int 0x10             ; Otherwise, print the character
    jmp .print_char      ; And repeat

hang:
    jmp hang             ; Infinite loop

hello_world db 'Hello World!', 0 ; String to print

TIMES 510 - ($ - $$) db 0 ; Pad remainder of boot sector with 0s
DW 0xAA55               ; Boot signature at the end of the boot sector
```

### 2. Assemble the Bootloader

Use `nasm` to assemble the bootloader:

```bash
nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader.bin
```

### 3. Create the Disk Image

Now, create a blank disk image and write the bootloader to it:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=minimal_boot.img bs=1024 count=1440  # Create a blank floppy image (1.44 MB)
dd if=bootloader.bin of=minimal_boot.img conv=notrunc  # Write the bootloader to the floppy image
```

### 4. Write a Bash Script

Combine the above steps into a Bash script named `create_bootable.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Assembling bootloader..."
nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader.bin

echo "Creating blank disk image..."
dd if=/dev/zero of=minimal_boot.img bs=1024 count=1440

echo "Writing bootloader to disk image..."
dd if=bootloader.bin of=minimal_boot.img conv=notrunc

echo "Bootable image created successfully."
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x create_bootable.sh
```

### 5. QEMU Command to Run the Image

Once the image is created, you can load it with QEMU using the following command:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=minimal_boot.img
```

### Final Notes

Make sure you have `nasm` and `qemu` installed on your system. You can install them using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm qemu-system-x86_64
```

This setup creates a very basic bootloader and does not load an operating system, but it shows how to assemble, create, and run a minimal bootable image with QEMU.
